# v2.0 is out

## Iridium is working again
The extension is now available for download and you can find it on AMO or the self-hosted option which is updated faster, you can find more at the download link instructions provided above.

A list of available features will be eventually updated and linked here, but for now check the projects for a draft of features implemented in each version update, as well as features planned for future versions.

This readme will be improved over time when possible.
