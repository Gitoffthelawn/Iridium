# Iridium v2.0 is out and working again
The extension is now available for download and you can find it on Firefox AMO Store, Chrome Web Store, or the self-hosted option which is updated faster. You can find more information in the [download](https://github.com/ParticleCore/Iridium/wiki/Download) instructions.

If you have any issue with the extension please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/ParticleCore/Iridium/wiki/Report-a-bug) before opening a new bug report.

A list of available features will be eventually updated and linked here, but for now check the projects for a draft of features implemented in each version update, as well as features planned for future versions.

This readme will be improved over time when possible.
